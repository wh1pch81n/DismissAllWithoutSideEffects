	// As described in the above comment, you may not want that behavior and instead want the top most view controller to dismiss with animation whil all the ones in between remain invisible.
	// Solution: you must move the view from the top view controller to the view controller of the presented view controller of the root.  But there is a cavet, if the top view has elements that connect to toplayout guide or bottom layout guide, then the views will shift.  the fix is to ensure that all view elements in the view don't use the top or bottom layout guide.
